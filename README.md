**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris dataset**
1. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset 
   using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to gain insights into the 
   characteristics of different iris species.

2. Analyzed the distribution and relationships of key features such as 
   sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to 
   understand their impact on iris species classification.

3. Visualized key patterns and trends in the dataset through 
   histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, facilitating a 
   comprehensive understanding of the data.
